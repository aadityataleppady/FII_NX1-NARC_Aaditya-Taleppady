# Aaditya-Nexus-Research

This project builds upon the open-source repository "CNN-LSTM-GRU" by TATU-hacker, available at:
https://github.com/TATU-hacker/CNN-LSTM-GRU

The original repository supports the research paper:
Dusmurod Kilichev, Dilmurod Turimov, and W. Kim, “Next–Generation Intrusion Detection for IoT EVCS: Integrating CNN, LSTM, and GRU Models,” Mathematics, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 571–571, Feb. 2024, doi: https://doi.org/10.3390/math12040571.

Their work provided the foundation for both the data preprocessing and model architectures (CNN-LSTM-GRU, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM-BiGRU). Modifications were made in this project, including the implementation of stacked ensemble learning and a custom filtering approach for isolating application-layer traffic. The ensemble model and filtering approach were not based on prior implementations.
